Rohith's Notes
1. Favicon for Tab (right now it's just a blue 'H')
2. Find and resize 3 images for carosol (1321px x 583px)
3. Add Open Source contributions section
4. Make project boxes stack sooner (wide width)
5. Add border around `Resume` in the header
6. Update contact section to have links (also update footer)


Jen's Notes
1. Edit timeline so it's compatible with screen width <600px
2. resize Devpost to match other contact icons (low priority)
